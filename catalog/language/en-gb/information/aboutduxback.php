				    <p>Originally developed for aviation and applied to Boeing cockpit glass, a Duxback treatment greatly <strong style='color: yellow;'>improves safety when driving in pouring rain especially at night.</strong></p>
				    <p>When driving over 40mph, rain water will be blown straight off the glass, no need for wipers!</p>
			    	<p>In wintertime ice will either not stick to the glass or will be much easier to remove.</p>
		    		<p>Research has shown that <strong style='color: yellow;'>visibility is improved by 35% </strong> when driving in pouring rain.</p>
	    			<p>Furthermore a driver's ability to identify a small object when driving in foul conditions is improved by 25%. A 25% improvement in reaction time is 58 feet at 40 MPH.</p>

                            Rainwater beads on the windscreen instead of smearing across it and the wipers are now able 
                            to completely clear the windscreen with every sweep. I would recommend this product to anyone, 
                            in fact I feel it should be applied to all new cars as a safety measure. I'd like to add that 
                            I have no business or personal connection with your company except as a very satisfied customer.";
